"Which training method is to be considered best? Answer: that of the natives of Hydra Island. Islanders and seafarers as they are, they soon take their boys on board ship and let them grow up in service. As soon as they achieve anything, they share in the spoils; and so they already take an interest in trade, barter and booty, and this forms the most competent coasters and seafarers, the most canny traders and the most audacious pirates. A basic group of this kind may of course nurture heroes who in their own person fix the destructive firebrand to the flagship of the enemy fleet. "

"If you haven""t been reading the newspapers for a few months and then read them all together, you realize how much time is wasted with these sheets of paper. The world has always been divided into parties, and this applies more especially nowadays; and whenever there is a situation of uncertainty, the journalist baits  either one party or the other, either more or less, and boosts our inner preference or dislike from one day to the next until, in the end, there is a decision and then, what has happened is an object of wonder, as though it were an act of God."
"Tycho de Brahe, a great mathematician, was only able to detach himself halfheartedly from the old system, which was at least in accordance with the senses, but which, in a spirit of wanting to be right, he sought to replace by a complicated clockwork, which was neither visible to the senses nor accessible to thought."

"and that (omitting a good deal) I faithfully toiled away at Erxleben""s manual of Naturestudy, that I kept up with the subsequent editions inordinately piled up by the zeal of Lichtenberg; and that I didn""t just read in print about new discoveries, but immediately came to know and inform myself about every new discovery as it was in progress, that I followed the great discoveries of the eighteenth century step by step right up to the present day, seeing them rise up before me like stars of wonder? Who can take away from me the secret joy of knowing that I myself, by unremitting attentive work, came so close to some great discovery which astonished the world? So close, in fact, that it seemed to break forth from my own innermost mind, as it were, and I then had a clear vision of the few steps which, in my darksome researches, I had failed to take?"
The first two genera are being and movement.
The impossibility of rendering an account of beauty in nature and in art;
The hero in a novel assimilates everything; the hero in the theatre does not have to find anything similar in what is all around him.
"In the realm of nature, the dominant factors are motion and activity, in the realm of freedom it is predisposition and will. Motion is eternal and is irresistibly in evidence on every propitious occasion. Factors of predisposition also develop naturally, but must first be put into practice by the will and then heightened by degrees. That is why one cannot be as sure about the spontaneous will as about independent action: the latter operates of its own accord, the former is operated on. For the will, if it is to be made perfect and effective, must be subject, in the moral realm, to conscience that does not err, but in the realm of art it complies with a rule that is nowhere formulated. Conscience has no need of an antecedent as it is selfcontained and only concerned with its own inner world. Genius might be in the same case of needing no rule, being self-sufficient, laying down its own rule; but as its field of action is the outside world, it is in many ways conditioned by its material and by time, with both of which there is bound to be difficulty. That is why everything connected with any art form, with its general management as with an individual poem, statue or painting, is so very curious and unpredictable."
"Memoirs from above downwards, or from below upwards: they are always bound to meet."
But endeavour what you can to remedy it.
"Anyone who wants to be active and busy need only consider what ought to be done at any given moment and in this way he can proceed without diffusing his energies. This is where women are at-an advantage, provided they understand it."
Matter is both without qualities and evil.
It is natural enough that people should imagine they can still do what they were once able to do; that others imagine themselves capable of doing what they never could do is perhaps strange but not infrequent.

"If this principle is not beautiful, nothing else could be that."
"Reasons for deduction are comparable to reasons for arrangement: both must be thought through completely, or else they are worthless. "
A scorched child shuns the fire; an old man who has been scorched is afraid to warm himself.
"Natural poets, so-called, are fresh and newly arraigned talents, rejects of an over-cultivated, over-mannered and halting artistic epoch. They cannot avoid the commonplace, so one can view them as retrograde; they are, however, agents of regeneration and they give rise to new progress."
Neither is time a quantity.
I have never used induction for quiet research on my own as I realized its danger soon enough.
"While some aristotelian categories are logically possible, the objects subsumed are impossible."
We know of no world except that in relation to human beings; we want no art except that which is the imprint of that relationship.

Refutation of the (james-lange) theory of emotions.
"Exceptional men of the sixteenth and seventeenth century in themselves constituted an academy. When knowledge proliferated so tremendously, private individuals joined together so as to achieve as a body what was no longer within the capacity of a scholar working on his own. They kept well away from state ministers, princes and kings. How hard the hidden French scientific societies tried to do without Richelieu""s help! How the English Oxford and London Society resisted the influence of Charles II and his favourites! But once the change had actually come about, and the sciences looked on themselves as state members of the state body, and were granted their due rank in processions and other celebrations, their higher purpose was soon lost to view; men paraded their own person, and the sciences, too, were draped in their little gowns and had on their little bonnets. I have given extensive examples of this kind of thing in my History of the Science of Colour. But whatever has been recorded in writing has been written so that it may continually be made actual."
The general and the particular coincide; the particular is the general made manifest under different conditions.
The French have renounced materialism and have conceded rather more spirit and life to primitive beginnings; they have freed themselves from sensualism and have allowed the depths of human nature some kind of intrinsic development; they allow for the validity of productive power and do not try to explain all art by the imitation of externally perceived objects. May they persevere in such directions.
A state of affairs which leads to daily vexation is not the right state.
"There is, and there will continue to be, much argument about the usefulness and the damage of disseminating the Bible.

Now in order to transform the tree into a picture I walk round it and look for its most beautiful aspect. I step far enough away to survey it completely, I wait till the  light is favourable, and by now a great deal of the ""tree-in-nature"" is supposed to have got as far as the sketch-block!"
Whatever I have tried to do in the past by false tendencies I have in the end learnt to understand.
To create a little flower is the labour of ages.
"What we think out, what we undertake, should have achieved such perfect clarity and beauty that anything the world could do to it could only spoil it; this would leave us with the advantage of only having to adjust what has been misplaced and refashion what has been destroyed."
"Similarly, it is not easily understood that things happen in the great sphere of nature exactly as they do in the smallest compass. If experience forces it on people, they in the end put up with it. Straw, attracted by a rubbed piece of amber, is cognate to the most terrific thunderstorm, indeed, it is one and the same phenomenon. We concede this relation-ship between small and great in a few other cases, but the pure spirit of nature soon abandons us and the demon of artificial constructionism seizes hold of us and manages to assert its validity everywhere."
Analogy demanded by the unity of god.
"Star-souls, like unincarnate souls, govern the world untroubledly."
Beauty comes from the form imparted by the originator.

"Shakespeare and Calderon have provided a splendid entry into this kind of reading aloud; however, one ought to consider whether the impressive strangeness, this talent soaring to a point of unreality, may not be precisely what could prove damaging to German training in this respect."

"People are like the Red Sea: the staff has hardly kept them apart, immediately afterwards they flow together again."
"What monarchs publish in newspapers doesn""t read well; for power should act, not talk. What liberals put forward is always readable; for if a man has been defeated because he cannot act, he at least wants to air his views by talking. ""Let them sing, if only they pay up!"" said Mazarin when he was shown satirical songs about a new tax."
Inclination is closely related and not rarely develops into love. It is cognate to a pure relationship which resembles love in every way except that it does not necessarily demand continued presence.

"To rule and to enjoy don""t go together. To enjoy means to belong light-heartedly to oneself and to others; to rule means to do good in the most seriously purposeful way to oneself and to others."
"It is quite natural that scientists cannot altogether agree with me, there being so many different ways of thinking: I too will go on trying to put across my own point of view. But it is now the fashion to argue and work against me even in the aesthetic and moral field. I know very well wherefrom and whereto, why and wherefore, but will not be more explicit on the subject. The friends with whom I have lived, for whom I have lived, will know how to maintain their own position and also keep me in remembrance."
Why soul assumes a circular motion.
"In the face of another""s great excellence the only possible salvation is love."
"A mathematician is only perfect in so far as he is a perfect man, sensitive to the beauty of truth; only on this condition will he make the impression of someone thorough, transparent, circumspect, clean, clear, attractive, indeed elegant. It takes all this to make him resemble Lagrange."
An artist who produces valuable work is not always capable of giving a reasoned account of his own achievements or those of others.
Absence of medium would interfere with vision only by destroying sympathy.

"""The Church weakens everything that it touches."""
The novel is a subjective epic in which the author begs permission to describe the world in his own way. So the only question is: does he have a way? the rest will come in due course.
"Crystallography has something of the monk and the confirmed bachelor about it, and it is therefore sufficient unto itself. It has no practical influence in a living context; for its most precious products, crystalline gems, first have to be cut and polished before we can use them to adorn our womenfolk."

"We are quite convinced that it is essential for the artist to make studies from nature; we won""t however deny that it often grieves us to perceive the misuse of such praiseworthy endeavours."
"A noble philosopher described architecture as frozen music and as a result had to watch much negative head-shaking. We believe this beautiful idea cannot be more aptly resurrected than by calling architecture music that has merged into  silence. Imagine Orpheus, when he was assigned a great desolate building site, shrewdly settling at the most appropriate spot and forming a large market place all around him by the life-giving music of his lyre. Rocky stones, rapidly reft from their massive blocks by the powerful command, the friendly enticement of music, were compelled to form an artistic and craftsman-like structure in their enthusiastic approach, and make up a fitting and orderly pattern of rhythmic stacks and walls. And in this way street may be added to street! Nor will strong protective walls be lacking. The sound of the music dies away but the harmony remains. The citizens of a town of this kind walk and work surrounded by eternal melodies; the spirit cannot sink, action cannot fall asleep, the eye takes over the function, the due work, the duty of the ear, and on the most ordinary day the citizens feel they are in an ideal state; without taking thought, without inquiring into causes, they enter into the highest ethical and religious delight. Make a habit of walking up and down in St Peter""s basilica and you will feel an analogue of what we have dared to put into words. The citizen of a badly built town, on the other hand, where fate has swept the houses together with a slack broom, unknowingly lives in a desert of dismal conditions; a stranger entering it feels as though he were listening to bagpipes, whistles and tambourines and would soon have to be watching bear dances and leaping monkeys."

Suicide unavailable even to avoid insanity.
"Strictly speaking, the theory of the use of corresponding angles is here included."
"Now if he is not inclined to learn from more highly skilled contemporary or earlier artists what he himself lacks in order to be a true artist, he will lag behind his own potential because of a wrong-headed idea that he is safeguarding his own originality; for we own not just what we are born with, but also what we can acquire, and this is what we are."
"In Rembrandt""s fine etching of Christ driving buyers and sellers out of the temple, the circle of light which usually surrounds the Lord""s head has been transferred, as it were, into his outstretched hand lit up in shining splendour at its divine work and striking out powerfully. About his head, as also his face, there is darkness."

Psychological theory of quality.
"The senses don""t deceive; judgement deceives."
"One thought, fills immensity."
"Improvement makes strait roads, but the crooked roads without Improvement, are roads of Genius."
"When basic primitive phenomena appear unveiled to our perception, we feel a kind of timidity, even fear. Sense-bound people take refuge in astonishment; but along comes reason, that busy pander hurrying to mediate in its own way between the noblest and the most vulgar instincts."
"Form as well as matter has to be digested, and it is in fact much harder to digest."
"Quite a number of things may have been invented, discovered long ago, and yet fail to be of influence in this world; things may influence and yet remain unnoticed, may influence yet fail to reach general effectiveness. Which is why every story of an invention has to grapple with the most extraordinary conundrums."
All who set themselves up against an ingenious cause are just striking against coals; sparks fly and kindle where they would otherwise have had no effect.
"What is remote from us influences us by means of transmission. In its usual form it may be described as historical; a higher form is related to the imagination, is mythical. If we look behind this form for a third factor, for some further meaning, it is transformed into mysticism. Moreover, it easily becomes sentimental so that we can only assimilate what we find congenial."

No misfortune is too great to be conquered by virtue.
"I find it almost natural that we have all manner of things to criticize about visitors, and that when they leave we judge them not all that charitably; for in a way we have a right to measure them by our own standards. In such cases even sensible and fair-minded people can hardly refrain from sharp censure."

"Aristotle was wrong in calling ""rough,"" ""united,"" ""rare,"" and ""dense"" qualities."
"As Socrates made an appeal to moral man so that he might quite simply become somewhat clearer about himself, so too Plato and Aristotle looked on nature as competent individuals: the former seeking to adapt himself by spirit and temperament, the latter to win it by analytical insight and method. And so every approach we can make to these three philosophers, as a whole or in detail, is an event that fills us with the greatest joy and always furthers our education in the most positive way."
Enough! or Too much!
"Error is related to truth as sleeping is to waking. I have observed that when one has been in error, one turns to truth as though revitalized."
"If we go back in history, we are always aware of personalities with whom we could get on and others with whom we should certainly be in conflict."
What actually is invention? It is the conclusion of what has been sought.
The earth feels and directs by the laws of sympathetic harmony.
"Intelligence thinks things not because they exist, but because it possesses them."
"No one contests the fact that vision is capable of estimating the distance between objects which are adjacent, or even above one another; what remains a point of contention, however, is our vision of objects placed one behind the other."
Time considered either as motion; as something movable; or something of motion.
"The English and French have outdone us in this respect.

A well-educated soldier has the greatest advantages in life as a whole as well as in society.
Refutation of the astrological system.
"Geometry studies quantities, not qualities."
The sciences should only affect the world by means of higher practical application; for they are really all of them esoteric and can only become exoteric if they correct some form of activity. All other participation leads nowhere.
That is why the Petersburg Academy has received no answer to its prize question; and extending the time limit will not serve the purpose either. The Academy should now double the prize and promise it to the one who very clearly and distinctly demonstrates why no reply has been submitted and why there could be none. Anyone capable of this would have richly deserved any and every prize.
"Just as in Rome, besides the Romans, there was also a people of statues, so, too, apart from this real world, there is also an illusory world, mightier almost, where the majority live."

"When contemplating nature, whether in great things or small, I have constantly asked the question: is it the object which is here declaring itself, or is it you yourself"
"Passional love may be elevating, though open to misleading temptations."
"Distinction between complements of being, and qualities."
The one may be conceived of as indivisible and infinite.
But above all things respect yourself.
How the two-fold soul exerts a two-fold providence.
The soul as the hypostatic actualization of intelligence.
You can neither protect yourself nor defend yourself against criticism; you have to act in defiance of it and this is gradually accepted. 
The soul can beget many because she is an incorporeal essence.
"True sages ask what a matter is in itself and in relation to other matters, and they are unconcerned about its usefulness, that is, the way it can be applied to what is familiar and necessary for life; for all that kind of thing will, in due course, be discovered by minds of quite different cast, by sharp-witted people who revel in life, have technical expertise and are versatile."
"Every good and bad work of art belongs to nature as soon as it has been produced. Antiquity belongs to nature, and, indeed, if it evokes response, it belongs to nature at its most natural, and we are not to study this noble nature, but only its common form!"
"But what is really most extraordinary: even when a man has discovered the basic reason for the error, this does not mean that he has got rid of the error itself. A number of English scholars, especially Dr Keade, speak out passionately against Newton: the prismatic image, they say, is by no means the sun image, but that of the opening of our window shutters decorated with colour borders; that in the prismatic image there is no original green, this arises when blue and yellow merge so that a black line, just as a white one, could seem to be dissolved in colours, if one wants to use the term ""dissolve"" in this instance. In short, all that we have been stating for years is now being similarly put forward by this good observer. But it so happens that the fixed idea of diverse refractability will not leave him, but he reverses it and is, if anything, even more caught up in this prejudice than his great master. Instead of being inspired by this new conviction and letting it release him from the chrysalis  state, he tries to squeeze his grown and unfolded limbs back into the old husks of the pupa state."
"Intelligence is not divisible; and, in its existence, is identical with thought."
"Pure nature mentality is an alien condition. The purer the mentality, the less need for the condition. The more complex, more interesting the condition is in itself, the more it lays down the law for our mentality."
The sciences as well as the arts consist of what can be handed down and learnt (the real part) and of what cannot be handed down or learnt (the ideal part).
How a number may be called infinite.
Qualities are accidental shapes of being.
"The first must be one exclusively, which would make thought impossible."
"If sensation is a soul-distraction, the stars a would not indulge therein."
Surely the world is quite full enough of riddles for us not to need to turn the simplest phenomena into riddles too?
"Publishers have declared themselves, as well as authors, to be above the law; how then do they propose to judge among themselves, and who will want to go to law with them? "
Aristotle's categories neglect the intelligible world.
Two possible hypotheses of ideas of individuals.
The relation of the air to the light.
"Much that is beautiful stands as an isolated entity in the world, but the spirit has to discover connections and thus to create works of art. The flower unfolds its full beauty only through the insect that clings to it, through the dewdrop that makes it glisten, through the calyx from out of which it may be drawing its last sustenance. No bush, no tree whose charm may not be enhanced by a neighbouring rock or brook, by a simple prospect in the distance. And so it is with human figures and so with animals of every kind."
